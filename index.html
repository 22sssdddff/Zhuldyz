    <h2>What Makes a Post Go Viral?</h2>
    <p>
      Social media plays a big role in today’s communication, but only a few posts go truly viral.
      This project explores what makes a post viral by analyzing
      <strong>5,000 top-performing posts</strong> from TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It focuses on <strong>platform differences, content types, and emotions</strong>
      to understand which factors drive views, likes, shares, and comments.

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project analyzes a dataset of <strong>5,000 viral social media posts</strong>
      collected from TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. Each post includes key
      engagement data — such as views, likes, shares, and comments — along with its
      main hashtag, content type, and platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dataset covers trending topics like fitness, education, challenges,
      comedy, and more. By focusing on the top-performing posts, the analysis explores:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How different platforms support virality</li>
      <li>Which hashtags and content types are most effective</li>
      <li>How engagement metrics relate to each other</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, a smaller subset of <strong>500 posts</strong> was examined for
      emotional tone, helping to understand how emotions like <em>joy, anger, or love</em>
      contribute to virality.
